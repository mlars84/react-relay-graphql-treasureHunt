# DEPRECATED

## This repo is no longer actively maintained.

This repo provided a basic starting point for building a "Relay Classic" (that is, Relay prior to version 1.0.0) application. All future development work is being undertaken on "Relay Modern" (version 1.0.0 and above).

The contents of this repo are being conserved for historical interest only, but we don't have any plans to update the code. If you'd like to get started with building a Relay Modern application, please see the link below. PRs to improve the documentation for the onboarding experience are welcome.
